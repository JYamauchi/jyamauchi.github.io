	<h2> Biography </h2>
	<p> I was born and raised in Hawaii since 1986 and I am currently living in Washington, DC. I have been learning about web developing as I could build a website from scratch by using the Ruby on Rails computer language. Most of my web development skills came from learning at the General Assembly School, where people can learn to become web developers in 12 weeks </p>

	<p>My current goal for being a web developer is to learn and expertise in Ruby on Rails and Javascript, so that I could become a fullstack developer as I use my designing skills to polish up the front-end such as CSS and adding my own graphic designs into the websites. </p>
